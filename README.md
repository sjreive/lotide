* countOnly: given an array and key, will return an object of keys that will contain the number of occurrences of that key in the array.
* eqArrays: given two arrays as arguments will return true if arrays are equal.
* eqObjects: given two objects as arguments, will reutrn true if objects are equal.
* findkey: function will find the value of key. takes in an object and a callback function.
* findKeyByValue: given an object and the object keys value, will return key name.
* flatten: will merge contents of array of array to a single array.
* head: will return first item in array
* letterPositions: takes in a sentence and will return an object of letters of the string as values and the number of occurrences as values.
* map: takes in array and callback function as arguemnts and will replace all instances of the array with what the specific function will return.
